            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>This project identifies and computes statistics on specific microglial densities around the hippocampal region of the brain. I developed this tool from scratch in Python to automate the cell-counting process and image analysis. The areas of interest are stained green by a specific protein, allowing me to pull the green channel and threshold it. From there minimum sizes are filtered out and we are left with the image for analysis.</p>
            <h3>Challenges:</h3>
            <p>Before the development of this tool I had never used Python before. I had to quickly learn and apply those new skills immediately. The library I was originally trying to work with was not easily compatible with Mac so I had to pivot a different direction. In addition, I got experience working directly with who this tool would benefit so incorporating feedback and understanding their vision was an added component.</p>

            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>This project was developed over the course of a semester for in a software development class. I worked in a small group, mimicking Scrum and Agile processes used in the workplace. We created a completely new platformer game given basic Java started code. The goal is to collect all the keys (and coins for a surprise) to free all the animals from the evil zookeeper.</p>
            <h3>Challenges:</h3>
            <p>My group worked seamlessly together providing an amazing atmosphere around the project. This allowed us to focus on other challenges like merge conflicts and prioritizing workloads. Most of the challenges we faced were very manageable and the entire team was able to help.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2><br>
            <p>I am a new graduate from Quinnipiac University. I graduated Magna Cum Laude in May 2024 with two degrees: a Bachelors of Science in Behavioral Neuroscience and Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2><br>
            <h3>My Origins</h3>
            <p>After my first year of college in psychology and natural science courses similar to those I took in high school, I was craving a new learning experience. I began taking computer science courses my sophomore year of college having no prior expereince in the field.  As someone who has always loved learning and excelled academically, I wanted the challenge of trying soemthing new. I was originally drawn to computer science as a tool because it is no secret that technology is playing an increasing role in all job fields. After taking my first few courses and getting past the steep learning curve, I have come to enjoy it more than I ever thought possible.</p>
            <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
            <p>I would like to do something that makes a meaningful difference. I want to work with real people to help real people. If I can feel proud of my contributions and see the impact my work makes, I'll know I'm successful.</p>
